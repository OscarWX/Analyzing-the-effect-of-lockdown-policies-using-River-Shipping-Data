# Analyzing-the-effect-of-lockdown-policies-using-River-Shipping-Data
The project analyzes the effect of lock down policy in Shang Hai during COVID using data from the largest river shipping platform in China. We gathered cargo transportation data from China's leading platform for river shipping business. The difference-in-differences (DID) method is utilized to compare the impact of transportation restriction on river shipping amount inside and across YRD. We find that the long-term/irreversible effect of transportation restriction harms the economy more than short-term/reversible effect. The result indicates that people's expectations and confidence regarding the restriction policies are more detrimental to the economy.

For the reasons of confidentiality I cannot disclose the data from the river shipping company.



# Acknowlegements
Transportation Restriction in YRD are piling severe pressures on logistics across the country. Everyone says it is exacerbating the economic fallout. However, is the transportation restriction the only reason driving economic fallout? Or, there are other inner-reasons.
We are interested in finding out the truth. Through the process, we found out the interesting and meaningful feature of the River Shipping transportation which can reveal the net and long-term/irreversible transportation restriction effect on the economy.
Luckily, we found the database of the first and largest platform for mating ships and cargoes across China. We collected all data in this platform from 2022-02-16 to 2022-05-31 at deal level across the whole country, which covered YRDâ€™s transportation restriction. 
Meiqian Wu took responsibility of collecting the data, Xiang Wan and Yuquan Xie were in charge of data analysis. All of us did the literature and writing, polishing the draft together.
Professor Wang Yuwei helped us in understanding the link between the logistics industry and the economy. Professor Xu Kaiquan mentored us on how to apply the difference-in-differences (DID) analysis method in the research. We shall express our sincere thanks to them for their tireless and helpful mentoring.
Thanks to the logistic companies we interviewed, their supports are crucial to our research.
